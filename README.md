Without any waste of time, let's start our journey of web development.

## #1 What is HTML? 

> * Also known as Hyper-Text Markup Language.
> * It is like MS Word for websites.
> * Most recommended programming language for website development.
> * No one can become a web developer without any knowledge of this.
> * You will be told to learn php, but it is a dead language, and modern people use modern languages.
> * I don't know what is it's history, but currently we use HTML version 5 for web development.

## #2 How to start quickly?

> * Use notepad or notepad++ (notepad++ is recommended)
> * Make a new text file on desktop - app.txt (say)
>   * Right click on desktop, click on "New", and then text file.
> * Name it "app" (say)
> * Right click on it, open with notepad.
> * In the notepad window, click the top left "file" button, "save as"
> * In the new window, select file type as "all files" and name it as "app.html"
> * Now delete the old "app.txt" file. (don't delete "app.html" file)

## #3 What to do next?

> * In the notepad window, type this code ðŸ‘‡
```html
<html>
  <head>
      <title>
          App
      </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Hello world.
  </body>
</html>
```
> * And save the file by pressing `Ctrl + S`.
> * Go to desktop, and double-click to open the "app.html" file.
> * You will see a new browser window, showing text "hello world" in the window.
> * If you observe carefully in the title bar (the browser tab) you will notice "App".

## #4 What did we actually do? What are "Tags"?

> * An HTML application is made by tags.
> * Tags tell the browser to do specific things to the things under them.
> * Example: the `<b>` tag talls the browser to make text bold until it gets ending tag `</b>`
#### Not got it yet? I got you.
> * So basically, tags are like this: `<tag> some text </tag>`
> * HTML has specific tags like `<b> bold text </b>`.
> * You can't make your own lovely tag.
> * Each tag has it's ending tag, as you see, ending tags have `</` instead of `<` in starting.
> * But some tags like `<img/>` dont have starting tags, they have `/>` in ending which doesnt need an ending tag.
